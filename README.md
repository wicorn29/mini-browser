Embedded Web Browser

This project is an embedded web browser implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple web browsing experience within a webpage, allowing users to navigate websites, go back and forward, reload pages, and more.

Features:

- URL Navigation: Enter a URL or search term in the address bar and press "Go" to navigate to the specified webpage or perform a search.
- Back and Forward: Navigate through the browsing history using the back and forward buttons, just like in a regular web browser.
- Reload: Refresh the current webpage by clicking the reload button.
- Proxy Browser: Enable the proxy browser option to browse the web through a proxy server. This option can be toggled on and off in the settings menu.
- Settings Menu: Access the settings menu to customize the browsing experience:
  - Theme Color: Choose a custom theme color to personalize the browser's background and header color. The selected color is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.
  - Default Color: Reset the theme color to the default setting.
- Responsive Design: The embedded web browser adapts to different screen sizes and maintains a consistent user experience on desktop and mobile devices.

Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Use the address bar to enter a URL or search term.
